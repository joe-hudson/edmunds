Edmunds API

This program connects to Edmunds online database for used car values.
My personal API key was removed, so to use this one must register with Edmunds
and obtain their own API key. Within the .py file, replace '<API_KEY>' with 
your key and it should work correctly from a command prompt. 

I am working on connecting this to a web interface to make it more accessible 
to all users. 

Thanks for taking an look, and let me know if you have any ideas.

Joe
