Edmunds API

Complete redo in process.
This was the first API I made and it was very simple and did not have structure.
I am in the process of remaking this into and actual app, using FW/1 framework, so please bear with me.

If you want to check out the code in action/inaction (still buggy), you can go here to see the current state: http://104.236.184.150:8888/edmunds/

Thanks for checking out my code.
