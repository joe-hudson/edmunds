Edmunds API

This program connects to Edmunds online database for used car values.
My personal API key was removed, so to use this one must register with Edmunds
and obtain their own API key. Within the .py file, replace '<API_KEY>' with 
your key and it should work correctly from a command prompt. 

I am working on connecting this to a web interface to make it more accessible 
to all users. 

Thanks for taking an look, and let me know if you have any ideas.

I coded the program in jQuery so that it could be added to a website much easier than the python
code. I initially changed it because the programmers at my internship did not know python, they needed
something they could maintain after I leave. So, check out the .html file for the jQuery code that is
functional simply by adding your API key. It currently returns the trade-in value for used cars. The VIN
lookup works most of the time, and I am looking into why it doesn't work all the time. Answers to come
soon.

Thanks for checking out my code.
